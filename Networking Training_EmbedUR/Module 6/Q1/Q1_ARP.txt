The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) plays a crucial role in packet forwarding by mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses, ensuring that data packets reach the correct device within a local network. When a device needs to send a packet, it must determine the recipient's MAC address, which is done by broadcasting an ARP request. The target device responds with its MAC address, allowing the sender to forward the packet. This process is essential for seamless communication within a network and for routing packets through a default gateway when sending data beyond the local network. Capturing ARP packets using tools like Wireshark is important for diagnosing network issues, such as devices failing to communicate due to incorrect ARP mappings or missing responses. Analyzing ARP traffic also helps detect security threats like ARP spoofing, where an attacker manipulates ARP responses to intercept or reroute network traffic. Network administrators can use ARP captures to monitor network performance, identify unauthorized devices, and enhance security measures by implementing static ARP entries
