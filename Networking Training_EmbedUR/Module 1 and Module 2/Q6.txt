Remote access lets you control a computer or server from another location. It’s useful for IT support, managing files, troubleshooting, and remote work. There are several ways to do this, depending on what you need.

Remote access systems such as VNC Viewer, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and similar applications typically follow these steps:

Install the remote access software on both the client and host systems.
The client and host exchange an address or access code provided by the application.
The client sends a request to connect to the host system.
The host system accepts the request, often requiring manual confirmation or a password.
The client gains access to the host’s desktop, enabling control and interaction.
