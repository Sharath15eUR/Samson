ping:
The ping command checks if a device (host) is reachable over the network by sending ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo requests and waiting for replies. It helps diagnose network issues like packet loss, latency, or disconnection.
 
Terminal:
greeniee@greeniee-VirtualBox:~$ ping -c 5 google.com

Observation:
Here i have pinged google.com with 5 packets and the connectivity, Latency and packet loss% is observed


arp:
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) resolves an IP address to a MAC (Media Access Control) address, which is essential for communication in local networks. The arp command helps in checking and managing these mappings.When a device wants to send data to another device on the same network, it needs the recipient's MAC address. Since devices communicate using IP addresses, ARP helps find the corresponding MAC address before sending the data.

Terminal:
greeniee@greeniee-VirtualBox:~$ arp -a
_gateway (10.0.2.2) at 52:55:08:00:02:02 [ether] on enp0s3
? (10.0.2.3) at 52:55:08:00:02:03 [ether] on enpos3
greentee@greeniee-VirtualBox:~$ 

Observation 
Here i have noticed that the machine has stored the MAC address of two other machines through ARP and has their IP stored

ifconfig
The ifconfig (interface configuration) command displays network interface details such as IP address, MAC address, netmask, and status. It is mainly used for troubleshooting or configuring network settings.

Terminal:
greentee@greentee-VirtualBox:-$ ifconfig
