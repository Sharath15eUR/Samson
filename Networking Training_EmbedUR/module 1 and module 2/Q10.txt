A DHCP server assigns IP addresses through a structured process known as DORA (Discovery, Offer, Request, Acknowledgment). When a device connects to a network, it first broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message to find an available DHCP server. The server responds with a DHCPOFFER, suggesting an available IP address along with other network settings such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server. The device then replies with a DHCPREQUEST, confirming its intention to use the offered IP. Finally, the DHCP server sends a DHCPACK, officially assigning the IP address to the device for a specific lease period. Once the lease expires, the client must renew the IP or request a new one. This automated process ensures efficient and conflict-free IP management, reducing the need for manual configuration while optimizing network connectivity.
