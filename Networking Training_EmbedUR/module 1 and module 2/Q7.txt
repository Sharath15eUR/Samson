Default gateway serves as the access point that connects a local network to external networks, including the internet. It facilitates communication between devices within the network and those outside it. To verify the reachability of the default gateway, its IP address must first be identified using commands such as ip route | grep default or netstat -rn. This IP address is typically assigned to the router, such as 10.0.2.1. Once obtained, the gatewayâ€™s status can be tested using the ping <gateway_IP> command (e.g., ping 10.0.2.1). A successful response indicates proper functionality, while the absence of a response may suggest network issues, such as misconfigured settings or connectivity problems.
