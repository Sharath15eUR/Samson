We are given the IP range 192.168.1.0/24, which means we have 256 total IP addresses (from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255). Now, we need to split this into 4 subnets.
Each subnet increases in increments of 64. Here’s how they break down:
Subnet 1:
Network Address: 192.168.1.0
Usable IPs: 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.62
Subnet 2:
Network Address: 192.168.1.64
Usable IPs: 192.168.1.65 – 192.168.1.126
Subnet 3:
Network Address: 192.168.1.128
Usable IPs: 192.168.1.129 – 192.168.1.190
Subnet 4:
Network Address: 192.168.1.192
Usable IPs: 192.168.1.193 – 192.168.1.254
