The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC address within a local network. When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it first checks its ARP table for the corresponding MAC address. If the MAC address is unknown, the sender broadcasts an ARP request packet, asking, "Who has this IP address?" The device with the matching IP responds with an ARP reply, providing its MAC address. The sender then updates its ARP cache and uses the MAC address for communication.

In the Wireshark capture, we observed ARP request and reply packets. The request packet contained the sender's IP and MAC address along with the target IP, The reply packet included both the sender's and target's MAC addresses, completing the resolution process.
